# Student Week Planner

## Introduction
This app has an interface that looks like a calendar showing one week. The students can use this
interface to mark their classes times and any other commitments they might have (extracurricular 
activities) in red indicating their busy time. The rest of times will be automatically marked in green
indicating free time. The students can use this color-coded interface to help them plan when to do
their tasks (homework, exam prep and projects). They can allocate time blocks to their tasks by
drawing boxes in the green areas in their calendar. Those time boxes will be yellow to differentiate
them from the other colors. Inside those boxes they can type few words to identify their tasks.

This program is interesting to me because over the past few years I wished I had a program that is
as convenient to use as described above. I have tried Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel and OneNote
to achieve the same idea. However, maintaining tables in all of these programs is a hassle. Using
a Calendar App such as Google Calendar is also a hassle because there are a number of settings that
you need to go through to set a calendar even all of which are unnecessary for the purpose I need.
I have not found an app that is simple and quick-to-use to plan when I am doing my tasks during the
week, which is the reason why I chose this idea to be my personal project for CPSC 210.
